{"verse":"3","text":"David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody and provided them with sustenance, but didnâ€™t go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood."}
