{"verse":"15","text":"“The Lord Yahweh says: ‘In the day when he went down to Sheol,31:15 Sheol is the place of the dead. I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its rivers. The great waters were stopped. I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him."}
