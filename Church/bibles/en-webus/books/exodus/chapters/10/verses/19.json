{"verse":"19","text":"Yahweh sent an exceedingly strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea.10:19 “Red Sea” is the translation for the Hebrew “Yam Suf”, which could be more literally translated “Sea of Reeds” or “Sea of Cattails”. It refers to the body of water currently known as the Red Sea, or possibly to one of the bodies of water connected to it or near it. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt."}
