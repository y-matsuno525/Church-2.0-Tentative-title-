{"verse":"4","text":"The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of Yahwehâ€™s temple all the vessels that were made for Baal, for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky; and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel."}
