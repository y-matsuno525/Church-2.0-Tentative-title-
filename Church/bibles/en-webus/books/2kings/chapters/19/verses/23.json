{"verse":"23","text":"By your messengers, you have defied the Lord, and have said, â€œWith the multitude of my chariots, I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon, and I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees; and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field."}
