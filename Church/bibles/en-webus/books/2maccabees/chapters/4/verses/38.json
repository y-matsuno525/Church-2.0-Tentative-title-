{"verse":"38","text":"Being inflamed with anger, he immediately stripped off Andronicusâ€™s purple robe, and tore off his under garments, and when he had led him round through the whole city to that very place where he had committed the outrage against Onias, there he put the murderer out of the way, the Lord rendering to him the punishment he had deserved."}
