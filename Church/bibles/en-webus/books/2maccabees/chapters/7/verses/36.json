{"verse":"36","text":"For these our brothers, having endured a 7:36 Gr. short pain of ever-flowing life.  short pain that brings everlasting life, have now 7:36 Gr. fallen. By the omission of one Greek letter the words would signify having endured a short pain, have now drunk of ever-flowing life under God’s covenant. died under God’s covenant. But you, through God’s judgment, will receive in just measure the penalties of your arrogance."}
