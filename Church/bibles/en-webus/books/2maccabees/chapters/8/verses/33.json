{"verse":"33","text":"8:33 The Greek text here is perhaps corrupt. As they celebrated the feast of victory in the 8:33 Or, country  city of their fathers, they burned those who had set the sacred 8:33 Or, porches gates on fire, including Callisthenes, who had fled into 8:33 Or, a solitary hut a little house. So they received the proper reward for their impiety."}
