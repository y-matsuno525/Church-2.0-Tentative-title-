{"verse":"21","text":"He was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the animalsâ€™, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky, until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he will."}
