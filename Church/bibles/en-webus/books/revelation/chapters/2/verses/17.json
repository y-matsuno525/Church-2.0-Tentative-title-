{"verse":"17","text":"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, 2:17 Manna is supernatural food, named after the Hebrew for “What is it?”. See Exodus 11:7-9. and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows but he who receives it."}
