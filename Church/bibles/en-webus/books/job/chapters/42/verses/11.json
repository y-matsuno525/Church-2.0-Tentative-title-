{"verse":"11","text":"Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, came to him and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money,42:11 literally, kesitah, a unit of money, probably silver and everyone a ring of gold."}
