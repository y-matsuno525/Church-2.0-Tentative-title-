{"verse":"34","text":"We have confirmed therefore to them the borders of Judea, and also the three governments of Aphaerema, Lydda, and Ramathaim (these were added to Judea from the country of Samaria), and all their territory to them, for all who do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the kingâ€™s dues which the king received of them yearly before from the produce of the earth and the fruits of trees."}
