{"verse":"10","text":"Then Ishmael carried away captive all of the people who were left in Mizpah, even the kingâ€™s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon."}
