{"verse":"10","text":"I am bowed down with many iron bands, so that I can’t lift up my head by reason of my sins,1:10 Some authorities omit by reason of my sins. neither have I any relief; for I have provoked your wrath, and done that which is evil before you:1:10 The Alex. MS. omits I did... commandments. I didn’t do your will, neither did I keep your commandments. I have set up abominations, and have multiplied detestable things."}
