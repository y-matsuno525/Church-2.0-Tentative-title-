{"verse":"9","text":"For I have sinned more than the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions are multiplied,1:9 The Alex. MS. omits O Lord... multiplied. O Lord, my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of my iniquities."}
