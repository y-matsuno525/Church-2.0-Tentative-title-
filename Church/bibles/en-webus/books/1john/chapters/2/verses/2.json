{"verse":"2","text":"And he is the atoning sacrifice2:2 “atoning sacrifice” is from the Greek “ιλασμος”, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation—the sacrifice that turns away God’s wrath because of our sin.  for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world."}
