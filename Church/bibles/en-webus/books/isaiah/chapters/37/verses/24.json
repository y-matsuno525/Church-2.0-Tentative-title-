{"verse":"24","text":"By your servants, you have defied the Lord, and have said, â€œWith the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees. I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field."}
