{"verse":"15","text":"“Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and we are in agreement with Sheol.28:15 Sheol is the place of the dead. When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’”"}
