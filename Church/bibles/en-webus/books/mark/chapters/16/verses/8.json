{"verse":"8","text":"They went out,16:8 TR adds “quickly” and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.16:8 One isolated manuscript omits verses 9-20 but adds this “short ending of Mark” to the end of verse 8: They told all that had been commanded them briefly to those around Peter. After that, Jesus himself sent them out, from east to west, with the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation."}
