{"verse":"13","text":"And now, my child, love your kindred, and donâ€™t scorn your kindred and the sons and the daughters of your people in your heart, to take a wife of them; for in scornfulness is destruction and much trouble, and in idleness is decay and great lack; for idleness is the mother of famine."}
