{"verse":"64","text":"The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before Yahwehâ€™s house; for there he offered the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings."}
