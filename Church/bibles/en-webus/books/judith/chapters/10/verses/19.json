{"verse":"19","text":"They marveled at her beauty, and marveled at the children of Israel because of her. Each one said to his neighbor, â€œWho would despise these people, who have among them such women? For it is not good that one man of them be left, seeing that, if they are let go, they will be able to deceive the whole earth."}
