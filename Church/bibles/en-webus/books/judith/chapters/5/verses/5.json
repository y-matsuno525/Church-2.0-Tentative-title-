{"verse":"5","text":"Then Achior, the leader of all the children of Ammon, said to him, â€œLet my lord now hear a word from the mouth of your servant, and I will tell you the truth concerning these people who dwell in this hill country, near to the place where you dwell. No lie will come out of the mouth of your servant."}
