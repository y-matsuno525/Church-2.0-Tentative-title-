{"verse":"11","text":"All those who lived in all the land made light of the commandment of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians, and didnâ€™t go with him to the war; for they were not afraid of him, but he was before them as one man. They turned away his messengers from their presence without effect, and with disgrace."}
