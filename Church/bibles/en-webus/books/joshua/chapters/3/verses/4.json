{"verse":"4","text":"Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits3:4 A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters, so 2,000 cubits is about 920 meters. by measure—don’t come closer to it—that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed this way before.”"}
