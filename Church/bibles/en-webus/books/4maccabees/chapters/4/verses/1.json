{"verse":"1","text":"For a certain man named Simon, who was in opposition to an honorable and good man who once held the high priesthood for life, named Onias. After slandering Onias in every way, Simon couldnâ€™t injure him with the people, so he went away as an exile, with the intention of betraying his country."}
