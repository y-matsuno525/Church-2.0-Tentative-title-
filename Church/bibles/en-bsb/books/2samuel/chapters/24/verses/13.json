{"verse":"13","text":"So Gad went and said to David, “Do you choose to endure three 24:13 LXX (see also 1 Chronicles 21:12); Hebrew seven years of famine in your land, three months of fleeing the pursuit of your enemies, or three days of plague upon your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.”"}
