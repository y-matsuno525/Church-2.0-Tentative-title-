{"verse":"11","text":"Uriah answered, “The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents,11:11 Or staying at Sukkoth and my master Joab and his soldiers are camped in the open field. How can I go to my house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? As surely as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do such a thing!”"}
