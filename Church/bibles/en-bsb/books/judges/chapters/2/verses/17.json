{"verse":"17","text":"Israel, however, did not listen to their judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned from the way of their fathers, who had walked in obedience to the LORDâ€™s commandments; they did not do as their fathers had done."}
