{"verse":"17","text":"And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave the order to count the people? I 21:17 Or I, the shepherd, see 2 Samuel 24:17 DSS and LXX. am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, please let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house, but do not let this plague remain upon Your people.”"}
