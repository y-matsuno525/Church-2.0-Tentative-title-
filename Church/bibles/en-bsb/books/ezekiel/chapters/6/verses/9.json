{"verse":"9","text":"Then in the nations to which they have been carried captive, your survivors will remember Meâ€”how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts that turned away from Me, and by their eyes that lusted after idols. So they will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their abominations."}
