{"verse":"16","text":"“And you, son of man, take a single stick 37:16 Or one branch; also in verses 17, 19, and 20 and write on it: ‘Belonging to Judah and to the Israelites associated with him.’ Then take another stick and write on it: ‘Belonging to Joseph—the stick of Ephraim—and to all the house of Israel associated with him.’"}
