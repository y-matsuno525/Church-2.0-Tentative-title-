{"verse":"17","text":"And as for you, son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says: Call out to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field: â€˜Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you, a great feast on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood."}
