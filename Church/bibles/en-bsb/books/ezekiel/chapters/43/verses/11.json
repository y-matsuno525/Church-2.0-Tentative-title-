{"verse":"11","text":"and if they are ashamed 43:11 Hebrew; LXX and Vulgate and they will be ashamed of all they have done, then make known to them the design of the temple—its arrangement and its exits and entrances—its whole design along with all its statutes, forms, and laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its complete design and all its statutes and may carry them out."}
