{"verse":"6","text":"Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, â€œDo not let your hair become disheveled 10:6 Or Do not uncover your heads and do not tear your garments, or else you will die, and the LORD will be angry with the whole congregation. But your brothers, the whole house of Israel, may mourn on account of the fire that the LORD has ignited."}
