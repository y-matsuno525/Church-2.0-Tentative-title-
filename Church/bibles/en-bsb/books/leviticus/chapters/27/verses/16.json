{"verse":"16","text":"If a man consecrates to the LORD a parcel of his land, then your valuation shall be proportional to the seed required for itâ€”fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley seed.27:16 A homer is a dry measure of approximately 6.24 bushels or 220 liters (probably about 291 pounds or 132 kilograms of barley seed)."}
