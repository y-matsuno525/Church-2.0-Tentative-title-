{"verse":"16","text":"“Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day, and I and my maidens will fast as you do. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish!4:16 Or if I am destroyed, then I will be destroyed!”"}
