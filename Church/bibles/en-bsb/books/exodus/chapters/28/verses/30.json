{"verse":"30","text":"And place the Urim and Thummim 28:30 Literally Lights and Perfections in the breastpiece of judgment, so that they will also be over Aaronâ€™s heart whenever he comes before the LORD. Aaron will continually carry the judgment of the sons of Israel over his heart before the LORD."}
