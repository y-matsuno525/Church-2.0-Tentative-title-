{"verse":"17","text":"So you are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread,12:17 That is, the seven-day period after the Passover during which no leaven may be eaten for on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt. You must keep this day as a permanent statute for the generations to come."}
