{"verse":"21","text":"In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil that is in front of the Testimony,27:21 The Testimony refers to the stone tablets in the ark of the covenant inscribed with the Ten Commandments. Aaron and his sons are to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the Israelites for the generations to come."}
