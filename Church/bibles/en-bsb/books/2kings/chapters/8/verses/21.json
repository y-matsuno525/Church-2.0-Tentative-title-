{"verse":"21","text":"So Jehoram 8:21 Hebrew Joram, a variant of Jehoram (the son of Jehoshaphat), as in verse 16; also in verses 23, and 24 crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. When the Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, he rose up and attacked by night. His troops, however, fled to their homes."}
