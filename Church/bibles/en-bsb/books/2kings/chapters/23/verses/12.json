{"verse":"12","text":"He pulled down the altars that the kings of Judah had set up on the roof near the upper chamber of Ahaz, and the altars that Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the house of the LORD. The king pulverized them there 23:12 Or quickly removed them from there and threw their dust into the Kidron Valley."}
