{"verse":"1","text":"Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his masterâ€™s sight and highly regarded, for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. And he was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.5:1 A leper, or one with leprosy, was one afflicted with a skin disease; here and throughout this chapter; see Leviticus 13."}
