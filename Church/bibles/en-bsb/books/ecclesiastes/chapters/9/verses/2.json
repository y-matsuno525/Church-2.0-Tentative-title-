{"verse":"2","text":"It is the same for all: There is a common fate for the righteous and the wicked, for the good and the bad,9:2 LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate; Hebrew does not include and the bad. for the clean and the unclean, for the one who sacrifices and the one who does not. As it is for the good, so it is for the sinner; as it is for the one who makes a vow, so it is for the one who refuses to take a vow."}
