{"verse":"22","text":"For seven days they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread 6:22 That is, the seven-day period after the Passover during which no leaven may be eaten; see Exodus 12:14â€“20. with joy, because the LORD had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to strengthen their hands in the work on the house of the God of Israel."}
