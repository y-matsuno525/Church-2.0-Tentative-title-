{"verse":"11","text":"But Jehoshabeath 22:11 Jehoshabeath is a variant of Jehosheba; twice in this verse; see 2 Kings 11:2. daughter of King Jehoram took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were being murdered, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest, was Ahaziahâ€™s sister, she hid Joash from Athaliah so that she could not kill him."}
