{"verse":"25","text":"And when the Arameans had withdrawn, they left Joash severely wounded. His own servants conspired against him for shedding the blood of the son 24:25 LXX and Vulgate; Hebrew of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him on his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings."}
