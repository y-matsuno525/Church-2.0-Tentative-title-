{"verse":"11","text":"Whenever the chest was brought by the Levites to the kingâ€™s overseers and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal scribe and the officer of the high priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this daily and gathered the money in abundance."}
