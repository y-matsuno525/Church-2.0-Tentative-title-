{"verse":"23","text":"The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, devoting them to destruction.20:23 Forms of the Hebrew cherem refer to the giving over of things or persons to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering. And when they had made an end to the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another."}
