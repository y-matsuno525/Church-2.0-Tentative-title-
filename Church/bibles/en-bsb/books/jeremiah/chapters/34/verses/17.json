{"verse":"17","text":"Therefore this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed Me; you have not proclaimed freedom, each man for his brother and for his neighbor. So now I proclaim freedom for you, declares the LORDâ€”freedom to fall by sword, by plague, and by famine! I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth."}
