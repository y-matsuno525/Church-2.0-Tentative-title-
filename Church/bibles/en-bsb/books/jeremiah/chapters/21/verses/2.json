{"verse":"2","text":"“Please inquire of the LORD on our behalf, since Nebuchadnezzar 21:2 Hebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant of Nebuchadnezzar (king of Babylon), which occurs frequently in Jeremiah. The latter spelling is used throughout Jeremiah for consistency. king of Babylon is waging war against us. Perhaps the LORD will perform for us something like all His past wonders, so that Nebuchadnezzar will withdraw from us.”"}
