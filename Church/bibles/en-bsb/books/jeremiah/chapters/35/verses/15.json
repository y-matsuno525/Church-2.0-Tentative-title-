{"verse":"15","text":"Again and again I have sent you 35:15 Literally Rising up early and sending (you), I have sent you all My servants the prophets, proclaiming: ‘Turn now, each of you, from your wicked ways, and correct your actions. Do not go after other gods to serve them. Live in the land that I have given to you and your fathers.’ But you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me."}
