{"verse":"3","text":"When the troops returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why has the LORD brought defeat on us before the Philistines today? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh, so that it may go 4:3 Or He may go with us to save us from the hand of our enemies.”"}
