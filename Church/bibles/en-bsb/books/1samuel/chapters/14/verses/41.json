{"verse":"41","text":"So Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Why have You not answered Your servant this day? If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim; but if the fault is with the men of Israel, respond with Thummim.”14:41 LXX and Vulgate; MT contains only the short quotation, “Give a perfect (lot).” And Jonathan and Saul were selected, but the people were cleared of the charge."}
