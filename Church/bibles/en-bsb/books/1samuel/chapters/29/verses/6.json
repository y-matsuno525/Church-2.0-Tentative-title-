{"verse":"6","text":"So Achish summoned David and told him, â€œAs surely as the LORD lives, you have been upright in my sight, and it seems right that you should march in and out with me in the army, because I have found no fault in you from the day you came to me until this day. But you have no favor in the sight of the leaders."}
