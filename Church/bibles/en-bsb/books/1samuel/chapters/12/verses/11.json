{"verse":"11","text":"So the LORD sent Jerubbaal,12:11 Jerubbaal is another name for Gideon and probably means let Baal contend; see Judges 6:32. Barak,12:11 LXX and Syriac; Hebrew Bedan Jephthah, and Samuel,12:11 LXX and Syriac Samson and He delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side, and you dwelt securely."}
