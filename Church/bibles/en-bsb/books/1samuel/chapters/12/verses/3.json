{"verse":"3","text":"Here I am. Bear witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed: Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated or oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe and closed my eyes? Tell me, and I will restore it 12:3 Hebrew And I will restore it; LXX Testify against me, and I will restore it to you.”"}
