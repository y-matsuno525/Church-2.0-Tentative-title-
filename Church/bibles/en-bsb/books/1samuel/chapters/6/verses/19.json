He struck down seventy men,6:19 A few late Hebrew manuscripts and Josephus; most Hebrew manuscripts 70 men and 50,000 men; LXX 70 men and 50,000 men of the people; Syriac and Arabic 70 men and 5,000 men; alternately, possibly 70 men and 50 oxen and the people mourned because the LORD had struck them with a great slaughter."}
