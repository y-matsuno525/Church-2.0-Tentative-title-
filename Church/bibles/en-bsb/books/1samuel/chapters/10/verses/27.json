{"verse":"27","text":"But some worthless men said, “How can this man save us?” So they despised him and brought him no gifts; but Saul remained silent about it.10:27 MT and LXX; One DSS manuscript includes Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had viciously oppressed the people of Gad and Reuben, gouging out the right eye of each Israelite dwelling there. He would not allow anyone to rescue them, and there was no Israelite east of the Jordan whose right eye had not been gouged out. But 7,000 men had escaped from the Ammonites and settled in Jabesh-gilead."}
