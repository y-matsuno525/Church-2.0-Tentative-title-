{"verse":"5","text":"After that you will come to Gibeah of God,10:5 Hebrew Gibeath-Elohim, meaning the hill of God where the Philistines have an outpost. As you approach the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place, preceded by harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be prophesying."}
