{"verse":"8","text":"So the women left the tomb and ran away, trembling and bewildered. And in their fear they did not say a word to anyone.16:8 Early manuscripts end the Gospel of Mark after verse 8. Other manuscripts contain only a short ending, a version of the following: 9 But they quickly reported all these instructions to Peterâ€™s companions. Afterward, Jesus Himself, through them, sent out from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. Amen."}
