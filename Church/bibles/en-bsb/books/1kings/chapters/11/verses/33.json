{"verse":"33","text":"For they have 11:33 Hebrew; LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate he has; twice in this verse forsaken Me to worship Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites. They have not walked in My ways, nor done what is right in My eyes, nor kept My statutes and judgments, as Solomonâ€™s father David did."}
