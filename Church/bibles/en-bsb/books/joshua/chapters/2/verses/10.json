{"verse":"10","text":"For we have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea 2:10 Or the Sea of Reeds before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan, whom you devoted to destruction.2:10 Forms of the Hebrew cherem refer to the giving over of things or persons to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering."}
