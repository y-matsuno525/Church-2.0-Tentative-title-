{"verse":"6","text":"For the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness forty years, until all the nationâ€™s men of war who had come out of Egypt had died, since they did not obey the LORD. So the LORD vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey."}
