{"verse":"16","text":"This is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb 18:16 That is, Mount Sinai, or possibly a mountain in the range containing Mount Sinai on the day of the assembly, when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God or see this great fire anymore, so that we will not die!”"}
