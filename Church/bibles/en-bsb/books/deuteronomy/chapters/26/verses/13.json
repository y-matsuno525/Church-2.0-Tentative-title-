{"verse":"13","text":"Then you shall declare in the presence of the LORD your God, â€œI have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all the commandments You have given me. I have not transgressed or forgotten Your commandments."}
