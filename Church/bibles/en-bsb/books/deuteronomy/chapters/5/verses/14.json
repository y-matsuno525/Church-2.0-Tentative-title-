{"verse":"14","text":"but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God, on which you must not do any workâ€”neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your ox or donkey or any of your livestock, nor the foreigner within your gates, so that your manservant and maidservant may rest as you do."}
